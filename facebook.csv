,,,Sue Mainland,1,That would be LE Metallica's idea of Heaven - a whole row of her Avanti Pendolinos! She gets so excited when she sees one - and does happy feet when the step appears to welcome her onboard!!!
,,,Ian Sanderson,2,"Pendelinos are not the newest trains on the network but in my opinion nothing out there comes close now the 125s and 225s have gone.
Virgins legacy lives on."
,,,Bomi Babalola,3,To where? Yall have cancelled most the services 😒😒
,,,Ian Bennett,4,Shame you've got no drivers to drive them
,,,David Inman,5,Good evening from 390009
,,,Adam Vabis,6,Don't you mean Strike Force assemble thus why they are all on red taillights and going nowhere.
,,,Chloe Jones,7,So that’s where they all are!
,,,Daryl Major,8,On 154 now and the new seats are fantastic
,,,Rick Meyrick,9,Staged deception !
,,,Matt Sumners,10,Is that because the drivers aren’t doing any rest day work….
,,,John Johnstone,11,Amazing machines. Just move enormous amounts of people quickly and most of the time without fuss or actually worthwhile recognition.
,,,Henry Pinney,12,Are the driver's on strike AGAIN 😡
,,,Deborah Smethers,13,Would be good if you actually ran a decent service....
,,,Daryl Kemp,14,And the beautiful Wembley in the background 😍
,,,Darren Nightingale,15,"Try running a reliable service instead of being on strike and cancelling trains. If you need more drivers or crew, employ them!"
,,,Michael Ryder,16,"Good evening Avanti West Cost , beautiful photo, have a great evening"
,,,Tega Fortune,17,Lovely 🥰
,,,Chris Jackson,18,That awesome picture
,,,Matthew Hall,19,Why does this look like some kind of Alien Taskforce about to strike?! 😂
,,,Dean McDermott,20,I’m going to be travelling with avanti soon I wonder if the train will actually run and if my reserved seat won’t be taken by someone else as they seem to double book them.
,,,Sean Dunn,21,Assemble on time
,,,Hira Subedi,22,Avanti West Coast Train 🚃 🚆
,,,Richard Bevan,23,"Best trains on the Network. Like the refreshed interior design and the seats are still confortable, not like the Hitachi trains."
,,,Carl Reynolds,24,Samantha Reynolds…..ready!
,,,Elizabeth Bowe,25,Great pictures
,,,Caleb Mumby,26,Would love to travel on one of these trains one day they’re the nicest trains around
,,,Nick Davis,27,There all parked up at Wembley yard
,,,Noel Stephen,28,These are the spares now the service to Manchester has been cut! Bring back Branson.
,,,Dave Haxell,29,Much better when they were with Virgin though
,,,Andrew Shatford,30,Shame you don’t employ enough drivers to move them
2023-11-23 15:44:00,"Laura at Runcorn Station is officially a Rail Hero!

This is her second award for setting up the station’s thriving community room. It's home to everything from a mental health support group to a ukulele band and has made a huge difference to the local community 👏",15,,,
,,,Logan Paul Murphy Music,1,This is great .. but Avanti rail you talk about mental health I've been sat at Preston station for nearly 4hours waiting for my train to Carlisle. The first one was cancelled. Second one an hour later just sailed right on through without stopping. The next one an hour later stopped but would not let me on because it was full . And now another hour later one has just gone through without stopping because apparently the train has a fault !! And now I've been informed I may use my ticket on a west coast train and have to travel via a different route. I asked in the office earlier and they wouldn't let me do this until now it suits you . Absolutely disgusting customer service. How can you plan a route and use the train when most days the trains are delayed or cancelled or just don't stop 🛑 Sorry for hijacking your post Laura. ❤️
,,,Debra A Knight,2,My son just got charged twice for an upgrade. What the hell like. It hit his bank twenty minutes apart. That is shocking . Sort it out Avanti.
,,,Paul Howes,3,Laura is a fantastic colleague comrade & friend & is always approachable Well done Laura ❣️
,,,Leo Martin,4,"I travel through Runcorn station most weeks and have never seen this? Unless it’s hidden away, it’s not doing it’s job as a community room very well!"
2023-11-22 13:45:00,"Welcome to Coventry station, Greggs! 😍",26,,,
,,,Ash Jackson,1,Why do the staff at the barriers ￼have such an attitude problem ?
,,,Malcolm Bell,2,You might not get a train due to strikes but at least you can get a sausage roll🤣😄
,,,Michael Ryder,3,"Good afternoon Avanti West Coast, a great way to travel on your trains, have a great evening"
,,,Guy Julian Harrison,4,the station building in Coventry is boring concrete 1960s building it should knock down and rebuild to better and nice looking building !
,,,Marc Holmes,5,Any plans to outsource the buffets on your Pendolino to Greggs?
,,,Chris Bentley,6,"Can we pre order for delivery to the carriage, like they use to in the 30s?
Especially on the down EDB service?"
,,,Francis Hook,7,What’s with the funny writing on the subtitles of the clip?
,,,Ash Jackson,8,When you going to open a first class lounge ? Like the old one
,,,Simon Riddler,9,"Used to always go to London by rail but it's too unreliable now so flying this time, sorry."
,,,Alison Burns,10,Steve Kell
,,,Callum Chillcott,11,Ryan Petersn
,,,Dave Norton,12,Will Wigan North Western be getting a first class lounge anytime soon?

2023-11-20 11:08:33,"We took an excited group of students to the Bolton Wanderers! 🙌

The Feel Good Field Trip group enjoyed a tour of the grounds, took part in team building exercises and had a Q&A with three players from the women’s team! ⚽",8,,,
,,,Max Parker,1,You haven't said why they were excited. Did you lie and tell them you were going to Edgeley Park?
,,,Ann Burgess,2,Did you get them back home again?
,,,Mike Shallcross,3,Did you arrive late ? 😉
,,,James Whitworth,4,I am awaiting my Automatic Delay Pay email that usually arrives according to the Avanti rubric within 48 hours. It's now past 96hrs. And why is the delay repay webpage so bloody infuriatingly mind-numbing! LNER have already contacted for the return trip and that was 48hrs AFTER the Avanti excursion!
2023-11-17 12:14:39,"Help us add some colour to the pedestrian subway at Rugby station!

Use the link to tell us what things, people and places remind you of Rugby.

Artist Stacey Barnfield will then transform your suggestion into an art piece for the subway that represents Rugby’s colour

,,,Dean McDermott,1,How about fixing your broken train company 1st that cannot even provide a reliable service.
,,,India Smiley,2,"Instead of commissioning some art piece, how about commissioning some better facilities at Rugby Station? Like a cafe or a bigger shop? The tiny WHSmith at the station is unreliable as it closes and opens whenever it wants. More ticket barriers would be nice as well as it takes ages to leave Rugby station at rush hour in the evening."

3. I was on the 15:22 from Euston to someplace and it was delayed! Nothing to do with Network Rail's infrastructure etc etc

,,,Helen McIntyre,5,Alex Withnall any thoughts?
